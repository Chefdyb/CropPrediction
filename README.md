# CropPrediction
For my crop prediction model, I trained a machine learning model to classify crops. This involved research in agriculture and computer vision to analyze data and predict crop yields. The project also serves as a learning tool for image classification techniques in agriculture, showing how machine learning can improve crop management.

The dataset contains images of crops categorized into three classes: Corn, Rice, and Wheat. It is intended for use in training machine learning models to classify different types of crops based on images.
It has a total of 3 classes and also, 2667 images.
